## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I have struggled a lot finding the right CSS for this challenge and also picking up the correct HTML elements. However, it was a good practice of positioning different elements with different sizes along the page layout.

### Continued development

After this challenge, my focus is to try writing cleaner code, more readable to anyone and with less effort. I need to pay more attention at the selection of the right elements in HTML, which make it easier to implement good and clean CSS after.
